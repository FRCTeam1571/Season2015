Electrical wishlist:
Wire crimpers, cutters, and strippers (Good ones!)
More terminals (The round ones that go onto the Jaguars and the flat ones that go into the spikes)
Our own soldering tools (Soldering iron, solder, desoldering gun)
Second copy of all new parts (RoboRIO, PDB, Pneumatics Breakout, Voltage Regulator)
